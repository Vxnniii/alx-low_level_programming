0x03 - C debugging

0. Multiple mains

1. Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2. Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

3. Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
