C - more functions, more nested loops                               

                                                                    

0 - Write a function that checks for uppercase character.           

                                                                    

1 - Write a function that checks fot a digit (0 through 9)          

                                                                    

2 - Write a function that multiplies two integer                    

                                                                    

3 - Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed 

by a new line                                                       

                                                                    

5 - Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14,

 followed by a new line.                                            

                                                                    

6 - Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.    

                                                                    

7 - Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal     

                                                                    

8 - Write a function that prints a sqaure, followed by a new line

9 - Fizz-Buzz - Write a program that prints the numbers from line 1 - 100, followerd by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fuzz, the number and for the multiple of five print Buzz. For numbers wich are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

10 - Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
